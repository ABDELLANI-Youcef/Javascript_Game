# Javascript Game

## About

In this application, I created an RPG game in which the user controls Itachi (from the anime of Naruto), collect coin, and try to avoid the bombs.

To build this application we used:

- Javascript ES6
- Webpack
- Html/CSS
- Phaser 3
- Linters ( eslint and stylelint)

## Live-Demo

[The live demo link](http://youcef.abdellani.dev/javascript_game/)

## Features

- Moving the character.
- Increasing the speed and jumping abilities.
- using fireball technic to burn bombs.
- Submit score.

## How to play

In the beginning, Itachi has 100 points of life (hp). The user can use the arrows (left and right) to run, (up) to jump. each time he collects a coin he gets 10 points in score. If he get 12 coins the power points will be increased by 1, his speed and jumping abilities will increase and a bomb will be added to the scene. If the player gets touched by a bomb he will lose 20 points of score and 12 points of HP. If Itachi has 3 points of power he can use the fireball technic to burn the bombs by clicking ("Space"). if the HP arrives at 0, Itachi dies and the user loses.
