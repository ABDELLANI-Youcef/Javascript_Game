## Features

- Moving the caracter.
- Increasing the speed and jumping abilities.
- using fireball technic to burn bombs

## How to play

In the beginning Itachi has 100 point of live (hp). The can use the arrows (left and right) to run, (up) to jump. each time he collect a coin he get 10 points in score. If he get 12 coins the power point will be increased by 1, his speed and jumpg abilities will increase and a bomb will be added to the scene. If the player get touched by a bomb he will lose 20 points of score and 12 point of HP. If Itachi has 3 points of power he can use the fireball technic to burn the bombs by clicking ("Space"). if the HP is arrives to 0, Itachi dies and the user loses.
